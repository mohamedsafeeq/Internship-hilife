    <p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>  <p>in nature
         nothing is perfect and everything is perfect...</p><br>
<pre>there is the plesure in the
   pathless woods,
      
    there is a rapture on the 
   lonely share,
   
     there is a socity,where
    none intrudes,
    
      by the deep sea,and music
     and its roar;
     
       I love not man the less,
      But nature more.</pre></i>
